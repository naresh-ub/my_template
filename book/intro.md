# My Teachbooks template

Hi there! I am [Naresh Devulapally](https://naresh-ub.github.io), a Computer Science PhD student at [UB, SUNY](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html).

This website is my modified version of [teachbooks](https://teachbooks.io) thats based on [jupyter-book](https://jupyter-book.org). I have always preferred visual and interaction based learning. **This website is my effort to incorporate visualization and interaction in my teaching**.

I have been playing around with the [jupyter-book](https://jupyter-book.org) for a while (~3 years). [Teachbooks](https://teachbooks.io) has made a perfect template with all necessary features helping instructors like myself to just start writing content.

## Modifications made to teachbooks template
1. Removed image_inverter to preserve true colors of rendered images. (For my Summer 2025 Computer Vision course).
2. [Reveal.JS](https://revealjs.com/) integration for slides within jupyter-book.
3. Basic .css changes such as font, colors etc.
4. TikZ for better $\\LateX$ based images and graphs.

## Interactive animations

Checkout [my companion website](https://naresh-ub.github.io/cvip_remotion) for interactive animations using remotion.

::::{admonition} Been working on this for a while. Finally got it to work!
:class: tip, dropdown
I use a [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) website with [remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) integration to make interactive animations.
